## Advent of Scala is Advent of Code through Scala 3

This repository contains my attempts to learn Scala 3 by solving [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) problems (2015 - 2022).

### Usage

This is a normal sbt project. You can compile code with `sbt compile`, run it with `sbt run`, tests codes with `sbt test`, and `sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL.
